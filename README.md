# NiuCsFaculty

The project has two different branches: Master and version2.

The major change between the two versions is that the Master version is using a plist to display data whereas the version2 is parsing json data.

The app has a Tab bar control with five tabs.

## Tab1 - Faculty:
The tab lists all the faculty with their e-mail in a table view. There is also a label which says In Office when the faculty has office hours at that time. Clicking on any cell will take the user to a detail view which shows the name, e-mail, designation, website if any, e-mail and office hours. The present office hours, if present in the office will be labelled in green color for easy access. User can open the faculty website or send an e-mail from the app itself.

## Tab2 - TA:
The tab shows a PDF with TA information such as their name, class they are TAing for and their office hours.

## Tab3 - Courses:
The tab lists the courses taught in the Fall, Spring and Summer Semesters of that year in a PDF with switching between the courses using a segmented control.

## Tab4 - Programs:
The tab lists mobile device programming programs that NIU offers for Undergrad and Grad Students in a table view. Clicking on any cell takes the user to that particular webpage.

## Tab5 - About CS:
The tab shows the department Address, office hours, phone number and a map view that pins the department. User can tap on the phone number to call the department from app. This tab also has a info button, clicking on which takes you to the About App screen and to the author view.
